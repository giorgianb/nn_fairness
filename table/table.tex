%We use several neural network models to determine if an individual
%makes over $50k$.
%We make the following observations to helpe ase the reading of the table.
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item For the small model with no fairness action,
%		black's advantage over white is $0.29$. This means
%		if $t_1$ is the proportion of black individuals who
%		are judge to make $<50$k by the model,
%		and $t_2$ is the proportion of black individuals who
%		are also judge to make $<50$k using the white
%		criteria, $t_1 - t_2 = 0.29$. Out of all the black
%		population, 29\% of them would have not been judge to
%		make $<50$k if they had been white.
%	\item For the small model with no fairness action, the
%		model's preference for black features over white is
%		$0.39$. If $t_1$ is the proportion of black
%		individuals judge to make $<50$k by the
%		model, and $t_2$ is the proportion of white
%		individuals judge to make  $<50$k by the
%		model using the black criteria, $t_1 - t_2=0.39$.
%	\item For the small model with no fairness action,
%		white's advantage over black is $0\approx
%		\num{-5.55e-17}$. This means there is no
%		white individual that the model judged to make
%		$<50$k who would also not have not received
%		the same judgement if they were black.
%	\item We see that there is no difference in the preference and
%		advantage compared to no fairness action for either races when
%		the sex is permuted, which is expected. However, when we assign
%		to race and random weight, there is still no difference  in the
%		preferences and advantage compared to no fairness action for
%		either races, which is unexpected. Perhaps there is a mistake
%		in the model?
%	\item For the medium-sized model, it seems that permuting the race
%		makes it much more likely to thing that Blacks earn less. This
%		is suprising as when no fairness action, neither race had a
%		very strong advantage or preference.
